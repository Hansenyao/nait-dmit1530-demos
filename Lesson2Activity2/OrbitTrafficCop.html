            <h2>A Traffic Cop for Low Earth Orbit</h2>

                    On Earth, avoiding collisions is a key priority for traffic cops, air traffic controllers, and the
                    parents of toddlers. It is no different in space—and perhaps even more critical—given that objects
                    orbiting the Earth are moving at more than 17,000 m.p.h., which means that even very small objects
                    less than a centimeter in diameter have caused damage to the International Space Station, the Space
                    Shuttle, and satellites.

                    In fact, the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) estimates there are more than
                    500,000 such objects orbiting the Earth that are larger than a marble, and at least a million
                    smaller pieces of debris that cannot be tracked. Based on the growing number of commercial and
                    government launches of spacecraft, satellites, and even space stations, the number of objects that
                    will need to be catalogued, tracked, and managed is expected to grow significantly in the coming
                    years. And the solutions to this issue are fraught with both technical and political challenges.

                    A key organization charged with tracking and notifying the operators of space objects of a potential
                    course collision is the 18th Space Control Squadron (SPCS), part of the U.S. Air Force's Space
                    Surveillance Network (SSN), which currently tracks 27,000 objects in low Earth orbit (up to 2,000km
                    above the Earth's surface), medium Earth orbit (2,000km to 3,600km up), and geosynchronous
                    equatorial orbit (located 35,786km above the Earth).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 18th SPCS is co-located with the Combined Space Operations Center at Vandenberg Air Force Base
                    in Santa Barbara County, CA, and is charged with handling conjunction assessments (the close
                    physical encounters of two tracked objects in space), collision avoidance, and reentry assessment
                    for satellites and other objects returning to Earth from space.

                    Object tracking is handled via a network of sensors and telescopes located around the world and in
                    space, and utilizes two-line element (TLE) position datasets (which incorporate the parameters
                    required to uniquely identify an orbiting element at a given point in time), which can then be fed
                    into models that take into account atmospheric drag, gravitational drag caused by the Earth's shape,
                    the Earth's spin, and various other factors in order to predict the motion of each orbiting object
                    over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Space Surveillance Network also incorporates the Haystack Ultrawideband Satellite Imaging Radar
                    (HUSIR), which is located in the Lincoln Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
                    (MIT). HUSIR, the highest-resolution, longest-range sensor in the world, simultaneously generates X-
                    and W-band images that can provide valuable information about the size, shape, and orientation of
                    Earth orbiting objects. HUSIR was incorporated into the SSN in 2014.

                    In March 2020, additional object tracking capability known as the Space Fence, designed to provide
                    higher resolution for tracked objects, was declared operational. Located on Kwajalein Island in the
                    Republic of the Marshall Islands near the Equator in the Pacific Ocean, the Space Fence uses an
                    S-band radar system to track objects primarily in low Earth orbit (though it is also capable of
                    tracking objects in higher orbits), and allows the tracking of objects below the previous size
                    limitation of 10cm.
