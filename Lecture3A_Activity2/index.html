                <h2>Myth: Productivity is all about developer activity.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is one of the most common myths, and it can cause
                    undesirable outcomes and developer dissatisfaction. Sometimes, higher volumes of activity appear
                    for various
                    reasons: working longer hours may signal developers having to "brute-force" work to overcome bad
                    systems or
                    poor planning to meet a predefined release schedule. On the other hand, increased activity may
                    reflect
                    better engineering systems, providing developers with the tools they need to do their jobs
                    effectively, or
                    better collaboration and communication with team members in unblocking their changes and code
                    reviews.</p>
                <p>Activity metrics alone do not reveal which of these is the case, so they should never be used in
                    isolation
                    either to reward or to penalize developers. Even straightforward metrics such as number of pull
                    requests,
                    commits, or code reviews are prone to errors because of gaps in data and measurement errors, and
                    systems
                    that report these metrics will miss the benefits of collaboration seen in peer programming or
                    brainstorming.
                    Finally, developers often flex their hours to meet deadlines, making certain activity measures
                    difficult to
                    rely on in assessing productivity.</p>

                <h2>Myth: Productivity is only about individual performance.</h2>
                <p>
                    While individual performance is important,
                    contributing to the success of the team is also critical to measuring productivity. Measures
                    of performance
                    that balance the developer, team, and organization are important. Similar to team sports,
                    success is judged
                    both by a player's personal performance as well as the success of their team. A developer
                    who optimizes only
                    for their own personal productivity may hurt the productivity of the team. More team-focused
                    activities such
                    as code reviews, on-call rotations, and developing and managing engineering systems help
                    maintain the
                    quality of the code base and the product/service. Finding the right balance in optimizing
                    for individual,
                    team, and organizational productivity, as well as understanding possible trade-offs, is key.

                <h2>Myth: One productivity metric can tell us everything.</h2>
                <p>One common myth about developer productivity is that
                    it produces a universal metric, and that this "one metric that matters" can be used to score
                    teams on their
                    overall work and to compare teams across an organization and even an industry. This isn't
                    true. Productivity
                    represents several important dimensions of work and is greatly influenced by the context in
                    which the work
                    is done.</p>
