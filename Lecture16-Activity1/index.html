            <h2>Response of Technologists To Covid 19</h2>
            <p>The rapid spread of COVID-19 around the world during the first quarter of 2020 spurred a massive response
                across the technological base, not least in computer and data science. Scientists and technologists both
                inside and outside healthcare snapped into action as the scale of the outbreak became clear,
                some providing techniques they had been working on for years, others proposing new projects all aimed at
                arresting the virus' progress.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Example Projects</h2>
            <p>The European Molecular Biology Laboratory's Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), for example, already had
                a multiyear project underway to build a portal for anonymized genetic data from patients. Rolf Apweiler,
                co-director of EMBL-EBI, says it became clear at an early stage in the pandemic that those who suffered
                the most serious symptoms were "not only old people with underlying health conditions, but relatively
                young and healthy people. It is unclear why they are vulnerable and it may be in their genetic makeup.
                Understanding that is pretty important because if we want to go back to normal life, we want to
                find people who are vulnerable and need more protection."</p>

            <h2>Early Predictions</h2>
            <p>
                According to Apweiler, what would normally take several years was compressed to a matter of months. By
                mid-April 2020, the group had opened an early implementation of the portal.

                Before the pandemic got underway, warnings about a new epidemic came from data mining systems already in
                place. Social media technology provided the earliest clues to scientists working outside China, when
                Canadian company BlueDot and two research groups independently registered online chatter about a
                pneumonia-like disease at the end of December 2019. In internal reports, Chinese authorities had noted
                the existence of a novel virus-borne disease only a few days beforehand.

            <h2>Smarter Strategy</h2>
            <p>
                As the first wave passed, suppressed in many developed nations by a broad-brush lockdown and
                social-distancing campaign, the loose coalition of technologists working on data-driven
                methods to combat the disease turned their attention to ways to build a smarter strategy
                for controlling the spread of SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
