      Birds are warm-blooded vertebrates belonging to the class Aves. They are
      characterized by feathers, beaks, and the ability to lay hard-shelled
      eggs. Birds vary greatly in size, shape, and behavior, with over 10,000
      species found worldwide. From the tiny hummingbird to the majestic eagle,
      birds have adapted to a wide range of environments, from the coldest
      Arctic regions to the warmest tropical rainforests.

      Birds have an incredible ability to fly, which is made possible by their
      lightweight bones, powerful wing muscles, and specialized respiratory
      systems. Some birds, like penguins and ostriches, have lost the ability to
      fly but have adapted to other forms of movement, such as swimming or
      running.

      In addition to their physical adaptations, birds play important ecological
      roles. Many species are pollinators, helping to fertilize plants as they
      move from one flower to another. Others help control insect populations,
      while some are scavengers that help clean the environment.

      Birdwatching is a popular pastime for people around the world, as it
      offers an opportunity to appreciate the diversity and beauty of these
      fascinating creatures. Many bird species are also featured in folklore and
      mythology, often symbolizing freedom, wisdom, or spiritual significance.
