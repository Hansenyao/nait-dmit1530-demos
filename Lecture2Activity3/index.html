          Established as the first permanent settlement in the area of what is
          now Edmonton, the Hudson's Bay Company trading post of Fort Edmonton
          (also known as Edmonton House) was named after Edmonton, Middlesex,
          England. The fort's name was chosen by William Tomison, who was in
          charge of its construction, taking the fort's namesake from the
          hometown of the Lake family - at least five of whom were influential
          members of the Hudson's Bay Company between 1696 and 1807. In turn,
          the name of Edmonton derives from Adelmetone, meaning
          'farmstead/estate of Ēadhelm' (from Ēadhelm, an Old English personal
          name, and tūn); this earlier form of the name appears in the Domesday
          Book of 1086. Fort Edmonton was also called Fort-des-Prairies by
          French-Canadians, trappers, and coureurs des bois.

          Indigenous languages refer to the Edmonton area by multiple names
          which reference the presence of fur trading posts. In Cree, the area
          is known as amiskwacîwâskahikan, which translates to "Beaver Hills
          House" and references the location's proximity to the Beaver Hills
          east of Edmonton. In Blackfoot, the area is known as Omahkoyis;in
          Nakota Sioux, the area is known as Titâga; in Tsuutʼina, the area is
          known as Nââsʔágháàchú (anglicised as Nasagachoo). The Blackfoot name
          translates to 'big lodge', while the Nakota Sioux and Tsuutʼina names
          translate to 'big house'.In Denesuline, the area is known as Kuę́
          Nedhé, a metonymic toponym which also generally means 'city'.

          The earliest known inhabitants arrived in the area that is now
          Edmonton around 3,000 BC and perhaps as early as 12,000 BC when an
          ice-free corridor opened as the last glacial period ended and timber,
          water, and wildlife became available in the region.

          The site of present-day Edmonton was home to several First Nations
          peoples, including the Cree, Nakota Sioux, Blackfoot, Tsuut'ina,
          Ojibwe, and Denesuline. The valley of the North Saskatchewan River, in
          particular the area of Edmonton, was settled to varying degrees for
          thousands of years, and provided many essential resources, including
          fish, medicine, and materials for tool making, such as chert or
          quartzite, which are abundant in the area around the modern city and
          which can be easily knapped into tools such as axes, knives, and
          arrowheads.
