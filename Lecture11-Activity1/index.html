                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Developer productivity is complex and nuanced, with important implications for software development
                    teams. A
                    clear understanding of defining, measuring, and predicting developer productivity could provide
                    organizations, managers, and developers with the ability to make higher-quality softwareâ€”and make it
                    more
                    efficiently.</p>
                <p>Developer productivity has been studied extensively. Unfortunately, after decades of research and
                    practical
                    development experience, knowing how to measure productivity or even define developer productivity
                    has
                    remained elusive, while myths about the topic are common. Far too often teams or managers attempt to
                    measure
                    developer productivity with simple metrics, attempting to capture it all with "one metric that
                    matters."
                </p>

                <p>p>One important measure of productivity is personal perception;1 this may resonate with those who
                    claim
                    to be
                    in "a flow" on productive days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is also agreement that developer productivity is necessary not just to improve engineering
                    outcomes,
                    but also to ensure the well-being and satisfaction of developers, as productivity and satisfaction
                    are
                    intricately connected.</p>

                <p>Ensuring the efficient development of software systems and the well-being of developers has never
                    been
                    more
                    important as the Covid-19 pandemic has forced the majority of software developers worldwide to work
                    from
                    home,17 disconnecting developers and managers from their usual workplaces and teams. Although this
                    was
                    unexpected and unfortunate, this change constitutes a rare "natural experiment" that statisticians
                    can
                    capitalize upon to study, compare, and understand developer productivity across many different
                    contexts.
                    This forced disruption and the future transition to hybrid remote/colocated work expedites the need
                    to
                    understand developer productivity and well-being, with wide agreement that doing so in an efficient
                    and
                    fair
                    way is critical. </p>

                <p class="special">This article explicates several common myths and misconceptions about developer
                    productivity. The most
                    important takeaway from exposing these myths is that productivity cannot be reduced to a single
                    dimension
                    (or metric!). The prevalence of these myths and the need to bust them motivated our work to develop
                    a
                    practical multidimensional framework, because only by examining a constellation of metrics in
                    tension
                    can we
                    understand and influence developer productivity. This framework, called SPACE, captures the most
                    important
                    dimensions of developer productivity: satisfaction and well-being; performance; activity;
                    communication
                    and
                    collaboration; and efficiency and flow. By recognizing and measuring productivity with more than
                    just a
                    single dimension, teams and organizations can better understand how people and teams work, and they
                    can
                    make
                    better decisions.</p>
                <p>The article demonstrates how this framework can be used to understand productivity in practice and
                    why
                    using
                    it will help teams better understand developer productivity, create better measures to inform their
                    work
                    and
                    teams, and may positively impact engineering outcomes and developer well-being.

                <h2>Myths and Misconceptions About Developer Productivity</h2>
                <p>
                    A number of myths about developer productivity have accumulated over the years. Awareness of these
                    misconceptions leads to a better understanding of measuring productivity.</p>
                <section>
                    <h2>Myth: Productivity is all about developer activity.
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        This is one of the most common myths, and it can cause
                        undesirable outcomes and developer dissatisfaction. Sometimes, higher volumes of activity appear
                        for various
                        reasons: working longer hours may signal developers having to "brute-force" work to overcome bad
                        systems or
                        poor planning to meet a predefined release schedule. On the other hand, increased activity may
                        reflect
                        better engineering systems, providing developers with the tools they need to do their jobs
                        effectively, or
                        better collaboration and communication with team members in unblocking their changes and code
                        reviews.</p>
                    <p>Activity metrics alone do not reveal which of these is the case, so they should never be used in
                        isolation
                        either to reward or to penalize developers. Even straightforward metrics such as number of pull
                        requests,
                        commits, or code reviews are prone to errors because of gaps in data and measurement errors, and
                        systems
                        that report these metrics will miss the benefits of collaboration seen in peer programming or
                        brainstorming.
                        Finally, developers often flex their hours to meet deadlines, making certain activity measures
                        difficult to
                        rely on in assessing productivity.</p>

                    <h2>Myth: Productivity is only about individual performance.</h2>
                    <p>
                        While individual performance is important,
                        contributing to the success of the team is also critical to measuring productivity. Measures
                        of performance
                        that balance the developer, team, and organization are important. Similar to team sports,
                        success is judged
                        both by a player's personal performance as well as the success of their team. A developer
                        who optimizes only
                        for their own personal productivity may hurt the productivity of the team. More team-focused
                        activities such
                        as code reviews, on-call rotations, and developing and managing engineering systems help
                        maintain the
                        quality of the code base and the product/service. Finding the right balance in optimizing
                        for individual,
                        team, and organizational productivity, as well as understanding possible trade-offs, is key.

                    <h2>Myth: One productivity metric can tell us everything.</h2>
                    <p>One common myth about developer productivity is that
                        it produces a universal metric, and that this "one metric that matters" can be used to score
                        teams on their
                        overall work and to compare teams across an organization and even an industry. This isn't
                        true. Productivity
                        represents several important dimensions of work and is greatly influenced by the context in
                        which the work
                        is done.</p>

                    <h2>
                        Myth: Productivity measures are useful only for managers.
                    </h2>
                    <p class="special">Developers often say that productivity measures
                        aren't useful. This may come from the misuse of measures by leaders or managers, and it's
                        true that when
                        productivity is poorly measured and implemented, it can lead to inappropriate usage in
                        organizations. It's
                        disappointing that productivity has been co-opted this way, but it's important to note that
                        developers have
                        found value in tracking their own productivityâ€”both for personal reasons and for
                        communicating with others.
                        By remembering that developer productivity is personal,7 developers can leverage it to gain
                        insights into
                        their work so they can take control of their time, energy, and days. For example, research
                        has shown that
                        high productivity is highly correlated with feeling satisfied and happy with work.12,20
                        Finding ways to
                        improve productivity is also about finding ways to introduce more joy, and decrease
                        frustration, in a
                        developer's day.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2> Myth: Productivity is only about engineering systems and developer tools.</h2>
                    <p>While developer tools and workflows have a large impact on developer productivity, human
                        factors such as environment and work culture
                        have substantial impact too. Often the critical work needed to keep the environment and
                        culture healthy can
                        be "invisible" to many members of the organization or to metrics traditionally used for
                        measuring
                        productivity. Work such as morale building, mentoring, and knowledge sharing are all
                        critical to supporting
                        a productive work environment and yet are often not measured. The "invisible" work that
                        benefits the overall
                        productivity of the team is just as important as other more commonly measured
                        dimensions.21

                <h2>SPACE: A Framework for Understanding Developer Productivity</h2>
                <p>Productivity is about more than the individual or the engineering systems; it cannot
                    be measured by a single
                    metric or activity data alone; and it isn't something that only managers care about.
                    The SPACE framework was
                    developed to capture different dimensions of productivity because without it, the
                    myths just presented will
                    persist. The framework provides a way to think rationally about productivity in a
                    much bigger space and to
                    choose metrics carefully in a way that reveals not only what those metrics mean, but
                    also what their
                    limitations are if used alone or in the wrong context.

                <section class="special-section">
                    <h2>Satisfaction and well-being.</h2>
                    <p class="special">
                        Satisfaction is how fulfilled developers feel with their work, team, tools, or
                        culture; well-being is how healthy and happy they are, and how their work impacts
                        it. Measuring satisfaction
                        and well-being can be beneficial for understanding productivity20 and perhaps even
                        for predicting it.15 For
                        example, productivity and satisfaction are correlated, and it is possible that
                        satisfaction could serve as a
                        leading indicator for productivity; a decline in satisfaction and engagement could
                        signal upcoming burnout
                        and reduced productivity.
                        For example, when many places shifted to mandatory work from home during the
                        pandemic, an uptick occurred in
                        some measures of productivity (for example, code commits and speed to merge pull
                        requests).8 Qualitative
                        data, however, has shown that some people were struggling with their well-being.3
                        This highlights the
                        importance of balanced measures that capture several aspects of productivity: While
                        some activity measures
                        looked positive, additional measures of satisfaction painted a more holistic
                        picture, showing that
                        productivity is personal, and some developers were approaching burnout. To combat
                        this, some software groups
                        in large organizations implemented "mental health" daysâ€”essentially, free days off
                        to help people avoid
                        burnout and improve well-being.
                    </p>
                    <p class="special" id="unique">
                        It is clear that satisfaction and well-being are important dimensions of
                        productivity. These qualities are
                        often best captured with surveys. To assess the satisfaction dimension, you might
                        measure the following:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Employee satisfaction. The degree of satisfaction among employees, and whether
                            they would recommend their
                            team to others.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Developer efficacy. Whether developers have the tools and resources they need to
                            get their work done.
